## .NET Framework :

- It is a framework created by MS that develpers can use to develop applications easily.
- It is basically a collection of libraries.
- It has a number of pre-coded solutions that manage the execution of programs written specifically for framework.
  
### NOTE : A framework is just a bunch of code that a programmer can call without having to write it explicitly.

## Middleware :

- Middlewares are simple functions/methods having some logic which needs to be executed when client sents a request to Server.
- Eg: User requests a page which requires Authorization. Middleware is used to handle it.
- HTTP Request Pipeline - The request sent from Client side goes through HTTP Request Pipeline to Web App server.
- Middlewares are present in the pipeline.
- Then the response sent by the server again goes through the pipeline and reaches Client side.

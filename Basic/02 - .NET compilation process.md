## .NET compilation process :

- Compiling is the process of converting a program written in Higher level language (readable by humans) to Lower level language (understandable by machine) i.e binary or machine language.
- In case of .NET the code is not directly compiled to Machine code.
- It is first converted to "Intermediate Language" code.
- At the time when the application actually starts running i.e During runtime, the JIT compiler comes into picture which finally converts the IL code to machine code.
- The IL code is present in "bin" and "obj" folder in form of ".dll" (dynamic link library) file.

## NOTE : We can see the IL code by using a decompiler such as ILSpy

## Visual Studio vs VS code :

- Visual Studio runs only on Windows while VS code runs on multiple OS.
- Visual Studio is an IDE whereas VS code is a Editor.

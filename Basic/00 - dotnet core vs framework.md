## Dotnet Core :

- Version of .NET used to build Cross-platform apps, websites, etc.
- As cloud came into picture, MicroSoft realised that there apps should be able to run on cross-platform devices and thus .NET core emerged.
- Check installed version : dotnet --version

## Dotnet Framework :

- Version of .NET used to build any type of app that runs only on Windows.
- First released in 2003.
- Biggest problem : Ran only on Windows.

## .NET Core SDK :

- Used for development purpose.

## .NET Core Runtime :

- Mainly used for production purpose.
- When the app goes live, we don't need the whole development kit, we just need the runtime.

## Framework vs Language :

- .NET is a framework and C# is a language.
- .NET framework is like a big bag of libraries.
- In order to  use this libraries we need a programming language i.e C#.
- So the thing which we installed into our computer is .NET framework and the code which we write is the C# language.

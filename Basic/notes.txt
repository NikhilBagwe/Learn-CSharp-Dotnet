====> Projetcs and Solution in Visula Studio :

- In Visual studio, a "Solution" is a collection of projects.
- We can add multiple projects inside under one Solution.

For eg: BCMS solution has multiple projects under it.

BCMS : 
 - Business_layer 
 - Data_access_layer
 - User_Interface_layer

- Inside a project we can have multiple type of files, not just C# file.

= For solution file : .sln
= For project file : .csproj


====> .Net is supported by multiple languages :

- Currently we are using C#.
- But we can also use Visual Basic, F#, etc.

For eg : 
- The Console.WriteLine() is a library present in .NET framework and we use C# programming language to invoke it.

====>  The common platform in .NET is to compile the code to IL code.

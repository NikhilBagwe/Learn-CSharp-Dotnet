## API :

- An API can be descibed as "SQL over HTTP". Consider it as an analogy not technically.
- We use API endpoints written in C# to intuitively access data stored in DB.
- The API response is in JSON format.

## Models :

- Models are also referred as POCO - Plain Old C# Object.
- They are just like a normal C# class which represent a Table from DB.
- Each property represent a column in table.
- We can also create Models for SQL Joins and include Many to Many relationships.
